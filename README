Telegram Bot

This is a project very much in progress. While it was began at the very end of last summer, it was put on hold throughout the year. It is therefore very much in the early stages.
I created this project as I grew interested in creating some sort of 'bot' that would communicate over a messaging app, and the goal was to create a game that could be played by multiple people in a group chat, with the current thought being a quiz style game. This seemed like an interesting way for me to develop some of the skills necessary to implement a project like this, as well as provide something that hopefully would be of value to myself and my friends. After implementing the very basics of communication though, I returned to university, and this project was put on hold, I expect to return to it this summer with fresh eyes, and hopefully improve upon it, and implement the full game.
